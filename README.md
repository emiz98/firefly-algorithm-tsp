# Evolutionary Discrete Firefly Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem

## This is an implementation done by me using JavaScript and P5.

#### The paper that was related to this implementation was published by Gilang Kusuma Jati and Suyanto.

This paper addresses how to apply firefly algorithm (FA) for traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two schemes are studied, i.e. discrete distance between two fireflies and the movement scheme. Computer simulation shows that the simple form of FA without combination with other methods performs very well to solve some TSP instances, but it can be trapped into local optimum solutions for some other instances.
