        Evolutionary Discrete Firefly Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an implementation of the paper which is published by
        <span class="author">Gilang Kusuma Jati</span> and
        <span class="author">Suyanto</span>. They addresses how to apply firefly
        algorithm (FA) for traveling salesman problem (TSP)
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most intensively studied
        problems all round the world. TSP is although looking very simple
        problem but it is an important problem of the classical optimization
        problems that are difficult to solve conventionally. Basically in this
        problem a salesman needs to visit each city one time and returns back to
        the city from the start point of traveling. Exact completion on this
        issue will involve algorithms that require seeking the possibility of
        all the existing solutions so this problem is also belonging to the
        class of “NP-Complete” problems. As a result, execution time complexity
        of this algorithm will be exponential to the size of the input given.
